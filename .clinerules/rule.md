NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
- Follow provided specs exactly.
- Do NOT invent architecture, events, or data models.
- Do NOT skip approval gates or checkpoints.
- Do NOT implement future (V2+) features unless explicitly instructed.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Emit only canonical event types defined in specs.
- If unsure, STOP and ask instead of guessing.

EXECUTION RULES:
- Implement only the requested step.
- Stop when the stop condition is met.
- Provide files changed and a short summary.
